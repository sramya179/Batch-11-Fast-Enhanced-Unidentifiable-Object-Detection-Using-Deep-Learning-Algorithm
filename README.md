# Fast-Enhanced-Unidentifiable-Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Algorithm
In this project detects objects efficiently based on YOLO algorithm and FRCNN algorithm and apply the algorithm on image data and video  data to detect objects.
Our framework detects all the objects based on training set provided to it. Main view of this project is to increase the accuracy rate of the detection. It recognize the object even in blur stage or under less brightness,Over 60-65k images can be trained for detection.

# STEPS
Step 1 : Download the source code from github or directly open it in github. 
Step 2 : Download the Python version of 3.6.
Step 3 : Download the video,image required for this project.
Step 4 : Keep everything within a folder
Step 5 : Open the command prompt.
Step 6 : Set the path to the respective location
Step 7 : Then type "detection_video.py" in command prompt to execute the project file
Step 8 : And its starts video framing.
Step 9 : Once video framing is done.
Step 10: Then Open the folder and the output result will be present in the folder.
